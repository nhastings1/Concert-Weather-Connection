# Concert-Weather-Connect

Project One, Interactive Front-End Project of Christian Jones, Molly Hesse, Nick Hastings, and Brad Carlson. 

This website is designed using HTML, CSS (specifically foundation), and JavaScript. We've used two APIs to call information to the page. https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3 for the weather and https://platform.seatgeek.com/ for SeatGeek's API. The goal of our launched project is to present a website that allows the user to look up venues and see the weather so they can plan concert accordingly. 

# User story

As a user, I want to be able to check on my favorite venues. 
I want to be able to see the next 5 days of the venue's schedule. 
I also want to see the weather for those next five days. 
This allows me, the user, to plan my concert accordingly.


# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN this webpage meets accessibility standards

When I search a city in the form, 
Then I am given the top five venues and their events,
plus the weather for the next five days.

When user clicks on venue button,
Then schedule and forecast for that venue is presented.
