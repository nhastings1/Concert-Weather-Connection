# Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application:



# Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

As a user, I want to be able to check on my favorite venues. I want to be able to see the next 5 days of the venue's schedule. I also want to see the weather for those next five days. This allows me, the user, to plan my concert accordingly.


# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN this webpage meets accessibility standards

When I search a city or venue in the starterpage form, 
Then I am redirected to a new page with a list of venues, the venue schedule, and forecast, for the next five days.

When user clicks on venue button,
Then schedule and forecast for that venue is presented.

When user has searched specific venue,
Then they are presented with venues nearby.

# Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Tech used: 

Collectively: concept, boilerplate and initial git repo creation, wireframe, testing APIs. Initial challenges were attendance (unforseen circumstances) and a redirect on day two.
